The design can be further simplified if you decide to use your own Arduino UNO in which case you need not include the following materials onto PCB (Refer to "PCB V7 board.PNG"):

* DCJACK
* Diode D1
* Capacitors C1, C2, C3, C4
* ATMEGA328P IC1
* Voltage Regulator 7805T IC2
* Quartz Crystal 16MHZ Q1

It would be nice if someone can take the time to make a PCB without these items and in its place leave a line of male headers which would connect to the Arduino UNO as per the following pinouts:
