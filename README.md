# Connected Car Concept

The Connected Car Project, GateBox, allows you to operate your garage door and front lawn lights from the car's dashboard itself. It does this by having a smartphone interact with a gateway panel (the GateBox panel) that is placed within the garage. The smartphone is mirrored onto the car's dashboard. This is possible using a number of Connected Car features which are likely to grow popular in the future such as: Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, MirrorLink, AppLink, etc. This project was entered into the Microsoft Imagine Cup competition of 2015.

Please watch the introduction video below:

## Opensource
Since the Microsoft Imagine Cup competition, this project has been released on Github in hopes that it can be improved upon. The orignal app developed is in the "Windows Application Folder". Some of the files that were submitted to Microsoft judges are in the "Imagine Cup Files" folder. These files have been slightly modified since submission. 

## Where to Start?
First read the Bluetooth manuals. They are from the Bluetooth Special Interest Group and aim to teach how to develop Bluetooth Low Energy applications for a number of different platforms  - Android, iOS and Windows Phone.

For the electronics, there are two different ways to approach this project: The Simplified and Detailed way - One method uses a pre-existing Bluetooth LE chip and other method involves making this chip from scratch based on schematics provided. There is a Parts List and the Instructions version for the detailed and the simplified way. It is recommended that you start with the simplified way even if you plan to use the detailed way.

Read through the parts list for the electronics and the case enclosure in the "Parts List" folder. Then, read through the hardware and software instructions in the "Instructions" folder.

## What are Connected Cars?

### The following expert is from a 2014 CABA (Continental Automated Building Association) report:

*The connected car market, while still in its infancy, has rapidly evolved from a niche capability available in select models to a perceived must-have in the car industry. A connected car, by definition, is one that maintains a wide area connection (typically cellular-based) and often also a local area network (typically Wi-Fi). Via these connections the car is able to send and receive information relevant to the trip/route and the carâ€™s performance/condition.*

*An increasing number of vehicles are coming to market with the capability to support communications of various sorts. In 2013 more than one billion sensors were sold to the auto industry, more than doubling the 2009 levels[1]. While tethered and integrated solutions have dominated car connectivity to date, embedded connectivity solutions began appearing in 2014 with the number of such vehicles increasing in 2015 and beyond.*

*The connected car market is on the cusp of significant growth. A variety of market factors, from government regulations, to industry partnerships, to consumer demand, are propelling the connected car market forward. Consumers got a glimpse of the future of connected cars in 2014 as select models began rolling off the production line with these capabilities, but 2015 promises so much more in terms of number of connected vehicles and the services being delivered to those vehicles.*
