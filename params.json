It does by having a smartphone interact with a gateway panel (the GateBox panel) that is placed within the garage. The smartphone is mirrored onto the car's dashboard. This is possible using a number of features which are likely to grow popular in the future such as: Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, MirrorLink, AppLink, etc. This project was entered into the Microsoft Imagine Cup competition of 2015.\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YNrUQAdRSC8\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/YNrUQAdRSC8/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Connected Car Demonstration\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" border=\"10\" /></a>\r\n</div>\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
