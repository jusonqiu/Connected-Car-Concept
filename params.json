{"name":"Connected Car Concept","tagline":"GateBox: Connecting your Car to your Garage","body":"### GateBox - Connected Car Concept\r\nGateBox allows you to operate your garage door and front lawn lights from the car's dashboard itself. It does by having a smartphone interact with a gateway panel (the GateBox panel) that is placed within the garage. The smartphone is mirrored onto the car's dashboard. This is possible using a number of features which are likely to grow popular in the future such as: Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, MirrorLink, AppLink, etc. This project was entered into the Microsoft Imagine Cup competition of 2015.\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YNrUQAdRSC8\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/YNrUQAdRSC8/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Connected Car Demonstration\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" border=\"10\" /></a>\r\n</div>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
