<p>GateBox allows you to operate your garage door and front lawn lights from the car's dashboard itself. It does this by having a smartphone interact with a gateway panel (the GateBox panel) that is placed within the garage. The smartphone is mirrored onto the car's dashboard. This is possible using a number of features which are likely to grow popular in the future such as: Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, MirrorLink, AppLink, etc. This project was entered into the Microsoft Imagine Cup competition of 2015.</p>
